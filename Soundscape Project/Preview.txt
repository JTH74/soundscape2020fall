In this preview, I have included the starting mp3 and .aup files which include The beginning ambiance of the soundscape without the dialogue. I tried to capture the chaos of a battle field starting out by adding in the sound of a helicopter(in the sounds 1-6) where it travels from the left headphone to the right to show the effect of its movement. This paired with the grass rustling I tied in allowed me to get a feel that the helicopter is flying right above. I also added the sounds of gunshots from left and right to show two sides of the battlefield and ended the current progress with the dropping of a bomb which I plan to add dialogue before and after this part. I did a lot with the direction of sound to try to create an environment so I hope that will pan out well. Going forward, I am looking to create the dialogue and try to incorporate silence to show grief for the next half. The biggest thing for me in this project will most likely be mixing the sounds so that the focus is properly held especially with how much background noise there is. This was very relevant in the coffee house soundscape that we heard awhile back since that soundscape also had a lot going at one time but captured the focus well. It will be really big to make sure to utilize changing the direction of the sound in order to create the focus with centered sound while letting background be either on the left or right.
