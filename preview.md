I have changed the design of my soundscape such that it is more of a day in: day out approach starting with a weather report and the skier getting ready to go to the mountain
before they start sking. There are more sounds of getting ready. I noticed that if I try to just make all the sounds while on the mountain, it is quite repetitive and dull. 
To counteract this, I am adding more sounds at the beginning to start the day.
